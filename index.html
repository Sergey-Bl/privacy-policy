                    <p>We and our marketing and outsourcing partners, affiliates, or analytics service providers use technologies such as cookies, beacons, scripts, and tags to identify a user’s computer/device and to “remember” things about your visit, such as your preferences or a user name and password.

We may use this information to monitor, develop and analyse your use of the Service.</p>

                    <p>We may use your email address to contact you about your experience with the Sites and notify you about LostTides news and promotions. Your gender and birthday may be used to analyze user trends and target certain promotions.</p>

                    <h2 id="16-mobile-applications">1.6.	Mobile Applications</h2>

                    <p>When you use any of the LostTides applications or games on a mobile platform, we may record certain information and data, such as your application usage, access, session times and in-app purchases, your unique device ID (persistent / non-persistent), hardware type, the version of your operating system (“OS”), your device name, and your location (based on your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address). This information is useful to us for troubleshooting and helps us understand usage trends and improve and optimize the Services and your user experience, and may also be utilized for interest based advertising as described elsewhere in this Policy.</p>

                    <p>We may occasionally send you push notifications through our mobile applications to send you application or game updates, new content availability and other service related notifications that may be of importance to you. You may at any time opt-out from receiving these types of communications by turning them off at the device level through your settings.</p>

                    <p>With only your express consent, we or our partners may collect your precise location based information (GPS) for the purpose of tailoring content specific to your area (such as area based content packages), and to match your device location to certain points of interest for purposes of interest based advertising as described elsewhere in this Policy. Please note, participation in this part of the Service is not a requirement for all our applications and games. You may at any time opt-out from sharing your location by turning it off at the device level through your settings.</p>

                    <h2 id="17-advertising">1.7.	Advertising</h2>

                    <p>We may feature advertisements in our applications, games and elsewhere, both ourselves and with the help of our partners, and collect and use data and information about you and your device (including the presence of applications on the device or in use at a particular time on the device) in connection with such advertising, including your viewing of and interaction with any such advertising, in order to deliver, enable, target and optimize advertising and promotional information that is more relevant to you and is based on your application, game and device usage, online behavior and interests (this is commonly referred to as online behavioral or interest based advertising). We and our partners may also use cookies or similar tracking technologies to track the content you access or your device location for purposes of interest based advertising. The privacy policies of our partners may include additional terms and disclosures regarding their data collection and use practices and tracking technologies, and we encourage you to check those privacy policies to learn more about their data collection and use practices, use of cookies and other similar tracking technologies.</p>

                    <p>Advertisers on mobile devices and our third party advertising and analytics partners sometimes collect and use Advertising IDs to enable and optimize advertising. Advertising IDs are non-permanent device identifiers such as the Android advertising ID and/or Apple’s ID for advertising.</p>

                    <p>These advertisers and third party advertising and analytics partners may collect and use data and information about you, such as your Service session activity, viewing of and interaction with an advertisement, device identifier, geo-location information and IP address for the purposes of analyzing, tracking and measuring advertisement performance and to provide interest based advertising.</p>

                    <p>In addition, you may see our applications and games advertised in other services. After clicking on one of these advertisements and installing our application or game, you will become a user of our Service. In order to verify the installs, a device identifier may be shared with the advertiser or third party advertiser or analytics partner.</p>

                    <p>You can exercise an opt-out for interest based advertising services on mobile applications by checking the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and selecting “limit ad tracking” (Apple iOS) or “opt-out of interest based ads” (Android). If you would like to adjust your choices regarding the use of precise location data, you may also do so via your mobile device settings. Finally, many of our partner’s that enable online behavioral or interest based advertising are members of one or more digital advertising industry self-regulatory programs. You may click below for the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) to learn more about targeted or interest based advertising and to opt out of certain targeting programs. <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a> <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a></p>
